CSS 101:

There are three main ways to introduce CSS, on the top of your html as inclusions between style brackets
or as an external css stylesheet. All of this is done within the <head> brackets.

Internal:
    <style>
        p{
            attributes here.
        }

        .a_css_class{
            attributes here.
            Within any element, you can say class = "a css class" and get all these attributes
            IE: <p class = "a css class">
        }

        #duck{
            adds attributes to the element with the id "duck" (these should be unique and assigned when
            creating the element)
        }
    </style>

External:
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
    The code within the external style sheet is the same.


Bootstrap: (this is a dynamic stylesheet, which means it will play nicely with mobile and different
screen sizes)

    just include this: <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>

    The Bootstrap includes nice css classes:
        container-fluid (which autosizes the div)
        img-responsive (which resizes the img)
        And tons more, including buttons, etc.

Useful things:
    Font Awesome: which has tons of free svg's. Simply include the link and then use <i class = "">
        to make an icon.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"/>
