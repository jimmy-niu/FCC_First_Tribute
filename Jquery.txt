General Info:
    The most used javascript 'tool'
    As it is javascript, needs to be within the <script> tags.

Setup:
    Gotta include this:
    $(document).ready(function() {
        // Have shit in here?
    });

General Usage:
    use a $ to start each line, end with ;
    $ is called bling.
    A general line appears to be: $("the thing here").someFunction("");
        - "the thing here" can be a whole type, ie p or button, a class ie .well, or #some-id
